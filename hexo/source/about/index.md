### About me

Hello, my name is Yufang Hao. Welcome to my personal website.

I am  a Ph.D student in Environmental Engineering at Peking University, China. My research is focused on  the characterstics, sources and enviromental impacts of atmospheric particular matter.  

Although I am not a professional programmer, I often write simple codes to solve research problems. I am most familar with Python and its common packages as Pandas, MatPlotLib. I use [zotero](https://www.zotero.org) to organize the knowledge base, use [jupyter notebook](http://jupyter.org/) to write most of my work.
